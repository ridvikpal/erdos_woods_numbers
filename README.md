# erdos_woods_numbers
In number theory, a positive integer k is said to be an Erd  ̋os–Woods number if there exists a positive integer a such that each of the consecutive integers a + i for 0 < i < k shares at least one prime factor with either a or a + k. In other words, if for a k there is an a such that each evaluation of gcd(a, a + i) > 1 or gcd(a + k, a + i) > 1 returns true, then k is an Erdos–Woods number.

This program searches for erdos woods numbers given a set of parameters:
1. The number to start searching for k. It needs to be greater than 2. Your program will start searching for Erd  ̋os-Woods number from this starting point (inclusive).
2. The number to stop searching for k (inclusive). It needs to be greater than the starting point above searching for k.
3. The number to start searching for a (inclusive). It needs to be positive (greater than 0).
4. The number to stop searching for a (inclusive). It needs to be greater than the starting point above searching for a.
